## Smartmontools

This is a replacement for the `system/storage/smartmontools` package found
in the Solaris userland gate.

The smartmontools package contains two utility programs, smartctl and
smartd, to control and monitor storage systems using the
Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology System (SMART)
built into most modern ATA/SATA, SCSI/SAS and NVMe disks.

This package provides the latest stable smartmontools.  In addition, it
delivers `smartd` as an SMF service.
