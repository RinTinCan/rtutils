## geoclue

This is a replacement for the `library/desktop/geoclue` package found
in the Solaris userland gate.

This package provides the latest stable geoclue, which is needed to
support geolocation functionality in webkitgtk 2.26.0 and later.

Geoclue uses system dbus services, which are not normally enabled.
See [dbus](../dbus/) in this repo for more information.
