## GNOME Web (epiphany)

This is the GNOME Web browser, formerly known as 'epiphany'.

To build and run, you need the [webkitgtk4](../webkitgtk4/) package
from this repo, in place of webkitgtk4 from the Solaris userland gate.
In addition, you will need `libdazzle`, also found in this repo.

Performance is decent relative to Firefox.  Compare the results of the
JetStream test:

theme, available in this repo.)
