## GNOME Geary e-mail application

This is a very good e-mail companion to GNOME Web/epiphany.  However,
as the version number suggests, this is not production-ready code, and
you may experience some rough edges.

## Dependencies

You will need the WebKitGTK+ from this repo (2.22.3 or later), rather than
the one from the userland gate.

As well, you will need to update your vala with the latest vapi files
for WebKit.  You can get the current vala files from the GNOME vala repo.
