## nimbus themes for gtk3

If you are running gtk3 applications under Solaris 11.3 (i.e., the
Gnome 2 desktop with a nimbus theme), this component will allow gtk3
applications to co-exist visually seamlessly on the desktop alongside
gtk2 applications.

This component is based on the B00merang Project nimbus themes.
