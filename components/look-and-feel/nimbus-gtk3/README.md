## Nimbus themes for gtk3

If you are running gtk3 applications under Solaris 11.3 (i.e., the
GNOME 2 desktop with a nimbus theme), this component will allow gtk3
applications to co-exist visually seamlessly on the desktop alongside
gtk2 applications.

This component is based on the B00merang Project nimbus themes.


## Screenshots

Below are two gtk3 apps (system monitor, calculator) running alongside
a gtk2 app (terminal) under GNOME 2:
