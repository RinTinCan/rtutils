# UNFS

UNFS is a user-space implementation of the NFSv3 server
specification.  It provides a daemon for the MOUNT and NFS protocols,
which are used by NFS clients for accessing files on the server.

UNFS is useful if you want to export cross-zone LOFS mounts from a
non-global zone.

See http://unfs3.sourceforge.net/ for more information.
