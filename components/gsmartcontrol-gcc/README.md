# GSmartControl - GUI frontend for S.M.A.R.T. tools

## Overview
GSmartControl is a graphical user interface for `smartctl` from the
`system/storage/smartmontools` package, which is available in the
[Solaris Userland
Consolidation](https://github.com/oracle/solaris-userland).  This tool
supports the querying and controlling of S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring,
Analysis, and Reporting Technology) data on modern hard disk and
solid-state drives. It allows you to inspect the drive's
S.M.A.R.T. data to determine its health as well as run various tests.

## Features
* automatically reports and highlights any anomalies;
* allows enabling/disabling S.M.A.R.T.;
* allows enabling/disabling Automatic Offline Data Collection - a short self-check that the drive will perform automatically every four hours with no impact on performance;
* supports configuration of global and per-drive options for smartctl;
* performs S.M.A.R.T. self-tests;
* displays drive identity information, capabilities, attributes, device statistics, etc.;
* can read in smartctl output from a saved file, interpreting it as a read-only virtual device.

## GNU C++ Name Mangling

Solaris 11.4 and later ship with various C++ libraries that employ GNU C++
name mangling.  Among them are: glibmm, cairomm, pangomm, gtkmm, and sigcpp.

If you are running on 11.4 or later, or have rebuilt these libraries on 11.3,
then this is the target for you.

If you are running on 11.3 and have the original libraries above built with
Studio, then you should use [gsmartcontrol](../gsmartcontrol/).
