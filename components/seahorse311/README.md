# GNOME Seahorse for gtk2

## Overview
This is the last release of Seahorse for gtk2.  All subsequent
releases are for gtk3, so if you have only a gtk2 environment, this
will give you the latest.

Seahorse 3.1.1 contains several improvements over the Seahorse release
that was distributed with Solaris 11.3, including the ability to
change saved passwords.
