## mplayer

mplayer is a movie player.  It plays most MPEG/VOB, AVI, ASF/WMA/WMV,
RM, QT/MOV/MP4, Ogg/OGM, MKV, VIVO, FLI, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM
and RoQ files, supported by many native and binary codecs.  You can
watch VCD, SVCD, DVD, Blu-ray, 3ivx, DivX 3/4/5, WMV and even H.264
movies, too.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

* mplayer 1.3 requires ffmpeg 3.3.x (later versions *not* OK)
* mplayer 1.4 builds with ffmpeg 3.3.x or 4.1.x.  If you subsequently
change the version of ffmpeg, you must rebuild mplayer.
