## Building the individual components
You can build individual components or the contents of the entire repo.

### Component build
If you are only working on a single component, you can just build it using
following:

Setup the workspace for building components

    $ cd (your-workspace)/components ; gmake setup

Build the individual component

    $ cd (component-dir) ; gmake publish

### Complete Top Down build
Complete top down builds are also possible by simply running

    $ cd (your-workspace)/components
    $ gmake publish

The `publish` target will build each component and publish it to your
workspace IPS repo.
